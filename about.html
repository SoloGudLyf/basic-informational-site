      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h2>My Mission: My Tech Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        My mission is to leverage technology to create intuitive solutions, or
        continually grow and master the craft of software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in continuous learning, writing clean code and the power of
        collaboration. My focus is currently set on mastering Node.js and its
        ecosystem, driven by the principles learned through The Odin Project
        (T.O.P.) curriculum.

        <h2>The Story Behind My Code</h2>
        <p>
          My journey into development began in 2025 sparked by an interest in
          how websites actually work and technology as a whole
        </p>
        <p>
          I have focused my learning on the Full Stack JavaScript path of T.O.P
          which emphasizes building a strong foundational understanding through
          hands-on projects. This site, served locally using
          <strong>Node.js</strong>, is one of my first steps in applying those
          server-side skills in a live environment.
